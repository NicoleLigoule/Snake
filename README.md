Welcome to The Snake (my version).

Inspired by the famous snake game that used to come with the old Nokia phones, The Snake stays true to the classic: eat the dots to make the snake grow, and be careful not to collide with yourself!

Controls: 
- Arrow keys: up, down, right, left.

The game is still in development, so I'll be releasing updates shortly and will update this readme when it's ready.

See you soon! 🐍.
